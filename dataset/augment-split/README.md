# augment
augment for more qty

./augment.py provides scripts & utils to automatically augment sound files ./augment.py -h (--help) to get parameter help

The default location is './in' and the default save folder is './out' but you can specificy locations in the run paramters by

`./augment.py --source_dir=[source_dir] --dest_dir=[dest_dir]` to change.


`./augment.py --target_qty=[target_qty]` to set target end qty of files.

I am still playing with the effect settings as can not remember them from the harddrive disaster so prob need to be tweaked.
So now the effects settings are in effects.ini so that config can be shared.
The current settings are toned down and prob at min settings but should give not problems, but really should be tweaked up to give more variance. 
The effects.ini is simple and should be easy to edit and will get round to checking exact settings another time
